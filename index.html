      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a bootcamp student.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm originally from Cameroon residing in the United States.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>During spare time, I enjoy cooking, dancing, and gardening. Actually, dancing is my cardio. Haha. I prefer cooking my own food because I could spruce it up and always have a healthy meal. Yup! Eating guilt free and feeling safe knowing what I ingest doesn't contain ingredients I can't pronounce. For health is wealth. Also, gardening is like therapy. Inhaling the smells of the herbs and the soil takes one far away. Imagine taking a stroll in flowering park or on a get away in the tropics while getting a workout knowing the outcome will be fresh, healthy food, and a gorgeous yard. It is defintely a win. You should try it.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p> Hmmm! At the moment, I don't really like this question but, I would love to crown my degrees with the credentials of a web developer because I could become very flexible and also join the IT industry. Besides, being an entrepreneur is the creme of the crop. Not just any kind of entrepreneur but the kind that makes "big things happen". "If you know, you know" (wink). Well, with the current changes occuring, what if one becomes another version of Bill Gates? Haha, hope it is not too much to wish for. Okay, to keep it short and simple, I will also love to become a successful web developer. I mean the HOT and HIGH in demand kind.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p> Currently, I reside in the United States. I just can't narrow down the details on the internet because the world is full of "creeps". I don't mean actual creeps like gangs but creepy people. The crazies of the world. If you watch Life Time or the ID channel, you'll understand better. They project the craziest of the craziest in the world. You should watch it. Can be quite entertaining at times (not a paid ad).</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
