      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a bootcamp student.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm originally from Cameroon residing in the United States.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>During spare time, I enjoy cooking, dancing, and gardening. Actually, dancing is my cardio. Haha. I prefer cooking my own food because I could spruce it up and always have a healthy meal. Yup! Eating guilt free and feeling safe knowing what I ingest doesn't contain ingredients I can't pronounce. For health is wealth. Also, gardening is like therapy. Inhaling the smells of the herbs and the soil takes one far away. Imagine taking a stroll in flowering park or on a get away in the tropics while getting a workout knowing the outcome will be fresh, healthy food, and a gorgeous yard. It is defintely a win. You should try it.</p>
